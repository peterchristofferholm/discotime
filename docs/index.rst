Welcome to discotime's documentation!
=====================================

Discotime is a python package for discrete-time survival analysis
with competing risks using neural networks.
It relies on PyTorch Lightning to provide an easy-to-use interface,
but can still be customized to your heart's content. 
The packages contains an implementation of discrete time-to-event models
for neural networks (using PyTorch), different evaluation metrics,
and a couple of different competing risk datasets.
